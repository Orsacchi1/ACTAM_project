# ACTAM_project
ACTAM project for 2025

# MAIN IDEA
Create a comprehensive synth for long compositions and arrangements.  
The target is both music producers and live performers, thanks to the randomic nature of the sound sythesis can be used repeatedly for always new results.  

# MAIN FEATURES
- Create a sound based on a pseudo randomic algorithm
- Create groups of measures with fixed tempo, length and time signature that can be linked to each other
- Create a melodic or harmonic progression using a 2-times approach (fist duration, then tempo)
- Have a set of preselected progressions and pieces that can be transpose [e.g. jazz standards]

# GOALS/USE CASES
- Create tool for live performance (accompainment, improv, lead part) that one can program at home
- Generate an enviroment where sounds are very different from one to another in order for the artist to experiment and also create a community of people sharing different sounds
- Reduce the number of people needed for a Jam by arriving equipped with a bunch of presets useful for musical styles with a well known structure (e.g. Blues)
